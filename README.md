How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program?
As far as a project goes in a professional setting, the way in which the user interacts with the product is really the only thing that matters.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
My approach going into developing programs is to be as prepared as possible.
